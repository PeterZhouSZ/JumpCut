Source code of SIGGRAPH Asia '2015 paper *"JumpCut: Non-Successive Mask Transfer and Interpolation for Video Cutout"* by Qingnan Fan *et al.*

Check Qingnan's [homepage](<https://fqnchina.github.io/homepage/>) for the paper, supplemental material, slides, datasets and the other info.

Note
----

Due to the complexity of our interactive real-time system, the interaction part is not included in our distribution. And the interpolation is also part of our system, it's not within these codes either.

These codes include the main contribution of our algorithm, splitNNF, edge classifier and levelset. We provide a sample code for you to test. You can modify it based on this to fit your need.

Note that the edge map is computed with the codes [1] provides. You need to calculate the edge map with their codes first or you can also merge their MATLAB codes with ours using MATLAB Engine. In OpenCV 3.0.0, Dollar edge map is included, using their implementation is also a good choice.

The source codes of FPMLib.lib are in FPMLib.zip, just in case if you want to run these codes in Linux/64-bit systems.

Dependencies
------------

Our system is running under Cuda 6.5 and OpenCV 2.4.10 in visual studio 2013. If you want to change the configuration of our solution file, you can modify jumpcut.props and reload the solution file in visual studio.
